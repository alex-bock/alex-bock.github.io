                        The proliferation of news media available online simultaneously presents a valuable resource and significant challenge to analysts
                        aiming to profile and understand social and cultural trends in a geographic location of interest. While an abundance of news reports documenting significant events, trends, and responses provides a more democratized picture of the social characteristics of a location, making sense
                        of an entire corpus to extract significant trends is a steep challenge for
                        any one analyst or team. Here, we present an approach using natural
                        language processing techniques that seeks to quantify how a set of predefined topics of interest change over time across a large corpus of text.
                        We found that, given a predefined topic, we can identify and rank sets
                        of terms, or n-grams, that map to those topics and have usage patterns
                        that deviate from a normal baseline. Emergence, disappearance, or significant variations in n-gram usage present a ground-up picture of a topic’s
                        dynamic salience within a corpus of interest.

                        Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) often exhibit facial masking (hypomimia), which causes
                        reduced facial expressiveness. This can make it difficult for those who interact with the person to
                        correctly read their emotional state and can lead to problematic social and therapeutic interactions. In
                        this article, we develop a probabilistic model for an assistive device, which can automatically infer the
                        emotional state of a person with PD using the topics that arise during the course of a conversation. We
                        envision that the model can be situated in a device that could monitor the emotional content of the
                        interaction between the caregiver and a person living with PD, providing feedback to the caregiver in
                        order to correct their immediate and perhaps incorrect impressions arising from a reliance on facial
                        expressions. We compare and contrast two approaches: using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
                        generative model as the basis for an unsupervised learning tool, and using a human-crafted sentiment
                        analysis tool, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We evaluated both approaches using
                        standard machine learning performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1scores. Our performance
                        analysis of the two approaches suggests that LDA is a suitable classifier when the word count in
                        a document is approximately that of the average sentence, i.e., 13 words. In that case, the LDA model
                        correctly predicts the interview category 86% of the time and LIWC correctly predicts it 29% of the time.
                        On the other hand, when tested with interviews with an average word count of 303 words, the LDA
                        model correctly predicts the interview category 56% of the time and LIWC, 74% of the time. Advantages
                        and disadvantages of the two approaches are discussed.

                        Human instructors must monitor and react to multiple, simultaneous
                        sources of information when training and assessing complex behaviors and maneuvers. The difficulty of this task requires the instructor to make mental inferences and approximations, which may result in less than optimal training outcomes. We present a novel performance monitoring and evaluation system that
                        automatically analyzes and contextualizes flight control and system data streams
                        from high-fidelity aircraft simulators to support, validate, and augment an instructor’s evaluative judgments during pilot training. We present initial results
                        from the CAMBIO system, which leverages machine learning to assess a pilot
                        trainee’s performance in executing flight procedures. CAMBIO’s machine learning approach currently achieves 80% accuracy in performance categorization.

                        We present the results of a suite of experiments
                        conducted with a 2D simulation of a multi-agent area coverage
                        problem. Agents perform a basic behavior of moving in a straight
                        line and responding to collisions by setting a new random
                        heading. Agents are optionally equipped with a subset of three
                        additional capacities: a timer that causes the agent to alter
                        its heading at regular intervals, a surface sensor that detects
                        areas that have not yet been covered, and an agent sensor
                        that detects the proximity of other agents. Our experimental
                        conditions included all combinations of these features and also
                        varied the task environment and the number of agents deployed.
                        We found that the usefulness of feature configurations depends
                        upon the task environment, number of agents deployed, and the
                        metric used to determine performance. The surface sensor feature
                        became more useful as the number of agents increased, while the
                        agent proximity sensor became less useful. The surface sensor was
                        generally useful early in the simulation, but became a hindrance
                        once the task was nearly complete. With one performance
                        metric, each of the three features alone was detrimental, while
                        a configuration combining them together was beneficial.
